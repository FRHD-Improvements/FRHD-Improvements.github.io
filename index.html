          <summary>When is it going to be released?</summary>
          <p>Released? Hah! <br><br> Seriously though, it is taking a long time to make on my own. I am working
            on building off of some awesome work by Calculus, but with the time that school is taking away from
            personal projects, I am hoping to start a closed alpha in late 2021 to early 2022. The first release
            will not be as good as the default editor, but I plan to work on it over time, adding new features and
            fixing bugs until it becomes what I envision for <em>Pinwheel</em>.</p>

          <summary>What have you done so far?</summary>
          <p>So far I have created a <b>really</b> fast <a href="https://github.com/FRHD-Improvements/FRTF-Generator">file format</a>,
            which uses my general-purpose <a href="https://docs.rs/frhd/0.1.53/frhd">rust library</a> <em>(documentation
            coming soon‚Ñ¢)</em>. I am currently working on getting the editor into a usable state.

          <p>I have become dissatisfied with the default editor. For what I plan to add, see the 
            <a href="#features">features</a> section.</p>

        <h2>Planned Features</h2>

        <p>I am going to have complete feature parity with the default editor by the first public beta. That being said, these <em>extra</em>
        features are certainly going to make their way into the editor at some point:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>More powerful curve tool/editor (See the editor <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com">here</a> for an idea).</li>
          <li>Shapes (circles, squares, hexagons, etc.)</li>
          <li>Select by points and move/delete</li>
          <li>Layers</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are the things I will <b>probably</b> add. I wouldn't bet on them though.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Scrub through time (I had a video describing this but it appears that it was deleted üôÅ).</li>
          <li>Smoother brush option</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I am also thinking about possibly having a paid version of the editor once I get it to a good state. The paid version would cost about
          5 USD, and it would unlock these features:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>General track gen</li>
          <li>Image2Track</li>
          <li>Shaded brushes (Automatically cross-hatch style shading)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I would also like to add in-editor publishing and riding (essentially creating a third-party client for FRHD) but as that may cause legal
          issues with Kano (they make lots of ad revenue on their website!) that may not be possible.
